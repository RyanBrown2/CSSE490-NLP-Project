# CSSE490-NLP-Project

Our project focuses on developing a Google extension for Amazon that enables customers to make more informed purchasing decisions by analyzing the sentiment of product reviews.

As online shopping continues to grow in popularity, customers face challenges in assessing the quality and suitability of products without the benefit of in-person experiences.

By utitilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically sentiment analysis technique, our project aims to enhance customer support on e-commerce platforms like Amazon.

The goal of our project is to provide customers with a reliable tool that quickly analyzes product reviews and determines whether the sentiment is positive or negative. 

By incorporating NLP learning techniques, we strive to deliver a more efficient and effective service that assists customers in their decision-making process.

This GitHub repository serves as a centralized hub for our project, containing code, documentation, and resources related to our Amazon product review sentiment analysis tool. 

We believe that by combining NLP techniques and sentiment analysis, our project can contribute to a more informed and satisfactory online shopping experience for customers.
